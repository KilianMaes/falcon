GMP binding activates PRKG1, which phosphorylates serines and threonines on many cellular proteins. Numerous protein targets for PRKG1 phosphorylation are implicated in modulating cellular calcium, but the contribution of each of these targets may vary substantially among cell types. Proteins that are phosphorylated by PRKG1 regulate platelet activation and adhesion, smooth muscle contraction, cardiac function, gene expression, feedback of the NO-signaling pathway, and other processes involved in several aspects of the CNS like axon guidance, hippocampal and cerebellar learning, circadian rhythm and nociception. Smooth muscle relaxation is mediated through lowering of intracellular free calcium, by desensitization of contractile proteins to calcium, and by decrease in the contractile state of smooth muscle or in platelet activation. Regulates intracellular calcium levels via several pathways: phosphorylates IRAG1 and inhibits IP3-induced Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores, phosphorylation of KCNMA1 (BKCa) channels decreases intracellular Ca(2+) levels, which leads to increased opening of this channel. PRKG1 phosphorylates the canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) family which inactivates the associated inward calcium current. Another mode of action of NO/cGMP/PKGI signaling involves PKGI-mediated inactivation of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA). Phosphorylation of RHOA by PRKG1 blocks the action of this protein in myriad processes: regulation of RHOA translocation; decreasing contraction; controlling vesicle trafficking, reduction of myosin light chain phosphorylation resulting in vasorelaxation. Activation of PRKG1 by NO signaling alters also gene expression in a number of tissues. In smooth muscle cells, increased cGMP and PRKG1 activity influence expression of smooth muscle-specific contractile proteins, levels of proteins in the NO/cGMP signaling pathway, down-regulation of the matrix proteins osteopontin and thrombospondin-1 to limit smooth muscle cell migration and phenotype. Regulates vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) functions in platelets and smooth muscle.",EEEIQELK,30,37,

14767,93312,Q6FI13,H2A2A,,Histone H2A type 2-A,CD4Tcells,"Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.",NDEELNK,90,96,
14793,135624,Q93034,CUL5,,Cullin-5,Gut,"Core component of multiple SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin 2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes, which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. As a scaffold protein may contribute to catalysis through positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The functional specificity of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex depends on the variable substrate recognition component. ECS(SOCS1) seems to direct ubiquitination of JAK2. Seems to be involved in proteosomal degradation of p53/TP53 stimulated by adenovirus E1B-55 kDa protein. May form a cell surface vasopressin receptor.",LKEEEKR,238,244,

14841,93009,Q01484,ANK2,,Ankyrin-2,Frontalcortex,"Plays an essential role in the localization and membrane stabilization of ion transporters and ion channels in several cell types, including cardiomyocytes, as well as in striated muscle cells. In skeletal muscle, required for proper localization of DMD and DCTN4 and for the formation and/or stability of a special subset of microtubules associated with costameres and neuromuscular junctions. In cardiomyocytes, required for coordinate assembly of Na/Ca exchanger, SLC8A1/NCX1, Na/K ATPases ATP1A1 and ATP1A2 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors at sarcoplasmic reticulum/sarcolemma sites. Required for expression and targeting of SPTBN1 in neonatal cardiomyocytes and for the regulation of neonatal cardiomyocyte contraction rate (PubMed:12571597). In the inner segment of rod photoreceptors, required for the coordinated expression of the Na/K ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger and beta-2-spectrin (SPTBN1) (By similarity). Plays a role in endocytosis and intracellular protein transport. Associates with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-positive organelles and binds dynactin to promote long-range motility of cells. Recruits RABGAP1L to (PI3P)-positive early endosomes, where RABGAP1L inactivates RAB22A, and promotes polarized trafficking to the leading edge of the migrating cells. Part of the ANK2/RABGAP1L complex which is required for the polarized recycling of fibronectin receptor ITGA5 ITGB1 to the plasma membrane that enables continuous directional cell migration (By similarity).",VKEDLEK,1555,1561,
