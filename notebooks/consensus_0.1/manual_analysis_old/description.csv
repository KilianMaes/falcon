5000_batch_2,95467,Brain,Phosphorylation,Yes,P46821,Microtubule-associated protein 1B,"Facilitates tyrosination of alpha-tubulin in neuronal microtubules (By similarity). Phosphorylated MAP1B may play a role in the cytoskeletal changes that accompany neurite extension. Possibly MAP1B binds to at least two tubulin subunits in the polymer, and this bridging of subunits might be involved in nucleating microtubule polymerization and in stabilizing microtubules. Acts as a positive cofactor in DAPK1-mediated autophagic vesicle formation and membrane blebbing.","The tissue matches with the protein description (neuronal microtubules). Moreover, the PTM at this position is reported on UniProt"

5000_batch_2,235230,Brain,Phosphorylation,Yes,P10636,Microtubule-associated protein tau,"Promotes microtubule assembly and stability, and might be involved in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity (PubMed:21985311). The C-terminus binds axonal microtubules while the N-terminus binds neural plasma membrane components, suggesting that tau functions as a linker protein between both (PubMed:21985311, PubMed:32961270). Axonal polarity is predetermined by TAU/MAPT localization (in the neuronal cell) in the domain of the cell body defined by the centrosome. The short isoforms allow plasticity of the cytoskeleton whereas the longer isoforms may preferentially play a role in its stabilization.","The tissue matches with the protein description (neuronal microtubules).
