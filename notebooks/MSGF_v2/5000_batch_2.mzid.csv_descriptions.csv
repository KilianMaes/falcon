After synthesis, participates in the formation of Golgi-derived membranous organelles termed Piccolo-Bassoon transport vesicles (PTVs) that are transported along axons to sites of nascent synaptic contacts (PubMed:19380881). At the presynaptic active zone, regulates the spatial organization of synaptic vesicle cluster, the protein complexes that execute membrane fusion and compensatory endocytosis (By similarity). Functions also in processes other than assembly such as the regulation of specific presynaptic protein ubiquitination by interacting with SIAH1 or the regulation of presynaptic autophagy by associating with ATG5 (By similarity). Mediates also synapse to nucleus communication leading to reconfiguration of gene expression by associating with the transcriptional corepressor CTBP1 and by subsequently reducing the size of its pool available for nuclear import (By similarity).",QQTLPRPMK,2836,2844,Pep_[-17QQTLPRPM+16K,0.0
